# open-bar
Open Bar is a cocktail-building web application.
Users can save their favorite drinks and current ingredients to MongoDB for future reference.
Pictures, ingredients (which dynamically indicate whether the user has them), & instructions are provided on the product page for each drink.
Users can filter drinks by 'Random', 'Classic Drinks,' or 'Favorites.'

This MVP project was designed and built under 72 hours to illustrate the bare-bone concept. You can find the [full video demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0-RgB52yoM).
